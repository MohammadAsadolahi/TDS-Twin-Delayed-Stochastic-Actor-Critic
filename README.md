# TDS
### official implementation of Twin delayed actor critic algorithm (a Stochastic Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithm for contiuous RL problems)
#### Preprint of the research paper: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3041837/v1
in the TDS resreach paper we aim to learn exploration mindfully according to the feedbacks in continuous RL 
**this project is a research project and owners have no responsibility of any loss for deploying this project in real environmentn**

### How to install requirements
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the project depend on, and they will be installed using:
```
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```
I keep updating the project to be compatible with new versions of libraries. If there was any problem with the diffrent versions of the required libraries let me know in the "Issues" section, so i can resolve them.  
  
**this code is implemented with Pytorch! i will add TensorFlow version soon and link to it here!!**
